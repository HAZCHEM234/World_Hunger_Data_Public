# Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository contains resources for conducting data analysis using various datasets. The project includes data files, Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and cleaning, and a PDF file for the final report.

## Files Included

1. **CSV Data Files**: 
   - [`data1.csv`](data/data1.csv): Description of what this dataset contains and its relevance.
   - [`data2.csv`](data/data2.csv): Description of what this dataset contains and its relevance.
   - [`data3.csv`](data/data3.csv): Description of what this dataset contains and its relevance.
   - [`data4.csv`](data/data4.csv): Description of what this dataset contains and its relevance.
   - [`data5.csv`](data/data5.csv): Description of what this dataset contains and its relevance.

2. **Jupyter Notebooks**:
   - [`data_cleaning.ipynb`](notebooks/data_cleaning.ipynb): This notebook includes code for cleaning and preparing data for analysis. It handles missing values, data transformation, and other preprocessing tasks.
   - [`data_analysis.ipynb`](notebooks/data_analysis.ipynb): This notebook contains code for performing data analysis, including statistical tests, visualizations, and any specific analytical methods used.

3. **Final Report**:
   - [`final_report.pdf`](reports/final_report.pdf): A comprehensive report summarizing the findings from the analysis. This includes methodology, results, conclusions, and any relevant visualizations or tables.

## How to Use

1. **Setup**:
   - Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can use `pip install -r requirements.txt` if a `requirements.txt` file is provided, or manually install libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `jupyter`, etc.

2. **Running the Notebooks**:
   - Open [`data_cleaning.ipynb`](notebooks/data_cleaning.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Execute the cells to clean and preprocess the data.
   - After cleaning, open [`data_analysis.ipynb`](notebooks/data_analysis.ipynb) and run the cells to perform the analysis and generate insights.

3. **Reviewing the Report**:
   - Open [`final_report.pdf`](reports/final_report.pdf) to review the comprehensive analysis and findings.
